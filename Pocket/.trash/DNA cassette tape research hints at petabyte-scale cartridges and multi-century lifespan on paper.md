Researchers from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China have developed a DNA cassette tape drive that functions exactly as one might expect. The experimental setup, published in [_Science Advances_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady3406) on September 12, is the first working prototype to combine DNA storage with a physical tape-based medium and a compact seekable drive — a clever attempt to merge the longevity of DNA with the scalability of old-school tape libraries.

Data is encoded into synthetic DNA strands, written to a reel of flexible film, and stored in a cartridge that can be loaded, spun, and addressed like magnetic tape. This theoretically yields petabytes-per-meter density and multi-century lifespan on paper. Still, when the system was put to the test in proof-of-concept experiments, it only managed to write a single 156.6KB file, with each read-write cycle taking nearly an hour.

Of course, what’s more important is what the prototype can actually do. To test the full write-read-rewrite loop, the team encoded five small files into DNA. These were deposited onto the tape via a built-in liquid handling system, then recovered using sequencing, deleted, and rewritten. The whole cycle played out automatically in a drive about the size of a lunchbox, complete with reel motors, a microcontroller, and an optical barcode reader.
