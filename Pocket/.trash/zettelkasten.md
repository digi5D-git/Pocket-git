German for "slip box."
An individual note is known as a [[zettel]].

A Zettelkasten makes connecting and not collecting a priority.

**Important traits**
- Hyper-textual (nodes of information)
- Principle of atomicity (contains one unit of knowledge)
- Personal (make it yours)

The zettelkasten encourages a bottom up appraoch to the numbering system. That's just the address to the idea. ==The real value is in the connection to other ideas.==
