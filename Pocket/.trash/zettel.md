Title: zettel

An individual note in a [[zettelkasten]]. Each note should contain just a single idea.

In the traditional sense, the layout of a zettel typically goes on a notecard on one side only so that you have the idea as atomic as possible. The purpose is to collect a bunch of [[atomic idea]]s in order to see patterns and links between other ideas.
