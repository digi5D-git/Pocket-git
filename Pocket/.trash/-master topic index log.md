# Topics/Concepts
*The purpose of this note is to act as a **MASTER** topic catalog card where your high level notes, summaries, or most relevant notes to a particular topic go. You don't need to include every single note you create here, that can go towards a [[Topic Concept Template]] note instead. **This** note acts as your bird's eye view, your top of the mountain sight, not the nitty, gritty details down below.*
