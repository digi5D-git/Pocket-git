# BAS

Basic Allowance for Subsistence, or BAS, is a benefit established to provide financial assistance to all active duty service members for their grocery and food expenses. Benefit is eligible to be increased on a yearly basis to keep up with inflation, similar to BAH.

BAS is not considered taxable income; therefore you are not required to pay state or federal income taxes. It is also not tied to pay grade or dependent status and also does not change due to a change in either of those statuses.

## How is it Calculated

BAS is calculated by the Department of Defense (DoD) with the amount set and any increases based on an increase in the price of food as identified by the US Department of Agriculture.

[^1]: BAS II is a monthly rate for enlisted members stationed at a duty station that has been determined to have inadequate food storage and is intended to offset additional costs due to these food storage considerations.
