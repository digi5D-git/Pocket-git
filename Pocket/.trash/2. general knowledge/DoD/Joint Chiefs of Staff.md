# The Joint Chiefs of Staff (**JCS**)

After the civil war the U.S. military grew in size & joint military action between the Army & Navy proved increasingly difficult. Two branches unsupportive of the other at both planning & operational levels. Issued developed from disagreements between the services during the Spanish-American War's Caribbean campaigns too.

To resolve this President Theodore Roosevelt established the Joint Army and Navy Board in **1903**. With representatives from the military heads & chief planners of both *Navy's General Board* & *Army's General Staff*. 

The **Joint Board** was established as an advisory committee in planning joint operations & resolve problems of common rivalry between the two services. The Joint Board proved of minimal use and little influence during war it disbanded in 1947.

Proposed as a counterpart to the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, the United Kingdom portion to the 1942 *Combined Chiefs of Staff* (CCS)^[supreme military body for strategic direction of the joint U.S.-UK war effort. Established during the 1942 Arcadia Conference between Pres. Roosevelt & Prime Minister Winston Churchill]  
Admiral William D. Leahy proposed a unified high command which would become the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  
First formal meeting of the JCS was held **9 February 1942**
