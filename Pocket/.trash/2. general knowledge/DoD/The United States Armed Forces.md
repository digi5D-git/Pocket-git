## The Branches

The 6 service branches of the Armed Forces:
- Army (**USA**)
	- *14 June 1775*
- Marine Corps (**USMC**)
	- *11 July 1798*
- Navy (**USN**)
	- *27 March 1794*
- Air Force (**USAF**)
	- *18 September 1947*
- Space Force (**USSF**)
	- *20 December 2019*
- Coast Guard (**USCG**)
	- *28 January 1915*^[1915 was creation of the Coast Guard, prior service was the **Revenue-Marine** founded *4 August 1790*]

- - - 

Each military service is assigned a specific role & domain of operations. With the **Army** conducting *land operations*, **Navy** & **Marine Corps** specializing in amphibious & maritime littoral operations, **Air Force** conducting *air operations*, **Space Force** conducting *space operations*, & the **Coast Guard** who uniquely specializes in *maritime operations* & also as a *law enforcement* agency.

Five of the branches are organized under the Department of Defense's military departments:  
	1. Army  
	2. Marine Corps  
	3. Navy  
	4. Air Force  
	5. Space Force

The Coast Guard is nominally under the **Department of Homeland Security** but may be transferred to the DoD's Department of the Navy at the direction of the President or Congress.  
Also, with the exception of the Coast Guard, the services only *organize*, *train*, & *equip* forces. The **Combatant Commands** are responsible for operational control of non-service retained forces.
