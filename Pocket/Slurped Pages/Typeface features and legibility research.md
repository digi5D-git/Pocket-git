## Abstract

In the early 20th century, reading researchers expressed optimism that scientific study of reading would improve the legibility of typefaces. Font-making was, however, complex, expensive and impractical for reading research, which was therefore restricted to standard commercial fonts. The adoption of computer typography in legibility studies makes the measurement, modification and creation of experimental fonts easier, while display of text on computer screens facilitates reading studies. These technical advances have spurred innovative research. Some studies continue to test fonts for efficient reading in low vision as well as normal vision, while others use novel fonts to investigate visual mechanisms in reading. Some experimental fonts incorporate color and animation features that were impractical or impossible in traditional typography. While it is not clear that such innovations will achieve the optimistic goals of a century ago, they extend the investigation and understanding of the nature of reading.
